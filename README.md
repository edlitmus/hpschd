The Writing-Through Mesostic Generator

A text file for input will be transmogrified into a piece of Mesostic poetry using a configured "Spine String".

## Mesostics

Of course not all mesostics are "writing through" style as Cage did often, they can just as easily be written as they are.

- 50% Mesostic: The CL is unique between itself and the previous CL.
- 100% Mesostic: The CL is unique between itself, the previous CL, and the next CL.
- A "meso-acrostic", arguably another version of a Mesostic, has neither of these limitations.

## Display


## I Ching

There are probably dozens if not hundreds of computer programs that simulate the I Ching.

So this doesn't mean to replicate them but to provide a source of randomness for calculating values of the Mesostic that is in line with the kind of approach Cage might do.

For instance, the property of how many words per line could be selected via chance operations.

The SS itself could be chance derived.


## Complexity

How could you demonstrate complexity and chaos here?
